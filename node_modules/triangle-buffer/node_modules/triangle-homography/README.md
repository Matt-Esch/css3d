# triangle-homography

Computes the 4 x 4 transformation matrix T such that TA = B, where A, is the known triangle and B is the target
triangle. A and B are both 4 x 3 matrices comprising of augmented homogeneous column vectors. A triangle generator is
produced from A so that many values of B may be computed.
